# Technical Documentation Page
I created a one page Technical Documentation website as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This project is the third of five projects required to complete the certification. In this project, I had to build a website that was functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/
